\section{Game Overview}

\subsection{Game Concept}
$<$This section should provide a short summary or description of the game. Imagine you are `pitching' the game to a friend while riding on an elevator. How would you describe the game in one minute or less? Why would they want to play it? What makes it sound fun and engaging?$>$
\subsection{Genre}
$<$This section should describe the genre of the game. Popular genres include action, adventure, sports, strategy, puzzle, racing and role-playing. Is the game a mix of genres (e.g. action-adventure or a clever combination that's never been tried before)?  Or maybe you have created an entirely new genre.$>$
\subsection{Target Audience}
$<$Great game designers always design their games with a specific audience in mind, and this section should describe that audience. For example, are you designing your game for young kids, older kids, adults? Boys, girls or both? Is the game designed for hard-core players who like deep, highly challenging games or casual players who like to play a little bit each day?$>$

\subsection{Platform}
$<$Is the game designed to be played on a game console? A mobile device? The web? A good game design targets a specific platform and uses the capabilities of that platform to its advantage. Doing a 3D first person action game in a web browser is hard (but not impossible!), and you can't count on your players having access to a joystick if they're going to be playing on a smartphone.$>$

\subsection{Look and Feel}
$<$This section should describe the look and feel of the game. Where does the game take place: in the real world? A fantasy world? Space? Underground? In the past? In the future? Is the game a 2D world? A 3D World? What does the art look and feel like: is it gritty and realistic, beautiful and fantastical or something else? Many GDD's include drawings or graphics to illustrate the visual concept.$>$

\subsection{Characters and Storyline \textit{(if applicable)}}
$<$Not every game needs characters and stories - for example, many puzzle games don't have them, but if your game does, this section should describe them. Does the player have an avatar? Does the character get help from other players? Are there non-playing characters (NPCs) or other live players (for example, in a multiplayer game) Are there enemies? Does the game have a story? Is there a fictional world or setting for the game that we should know something about?
