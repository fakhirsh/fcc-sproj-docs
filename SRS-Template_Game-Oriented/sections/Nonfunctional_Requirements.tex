% Content goes here
\subsection{Performance}
The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without significant degradation in response time. To achieve this, the backend server should be optimized for efficient data processing and the database should be properly indexed for quick retrieval of information.

\subsection{Reliability}
The system should have a high level of reliability to ensure that it is available and functional at all times. This can be achieved by implementing fault-tolerant mechanisms such as redundant servers, backup systems, and automated error detection and recovery.

\subsection{Security}
The system should have robust security measures in place to protect sensitive user data and prevent unauthorized access. This includes implementing secure authentication and authorization mechanisms, encrypting data in transit and at rest, and regularly updating and patching any security vulnerabilities.

\subsection{Scalability}
The system should be designed to handle increasing amounts of data and user traffic without sacrificing performance. This can be achieved by using scalable infrastructure components such as cloud services, load balancing, and horizontal scaling techniques.

\subsection{Usability}
The system should be intuitive and easy to use, even for users with limited technical knowledge. This can be achieved by following established user interface design principles, conducting user testing and feedback sessions, and providing clear and concise documentation.

\subsection{Maintainability}
The system should be designed in a modular and extensible manner to facilitate future enhancements and maintenance. This includes writing clean and well-documented code, using version control systems, and adhering to coding best practices and standards.

\subsection{Compatibility}
The system should be compatible with a wide range of devices, operating systems, and web browsers. This can be achieved by following web standards, using responsive design techniques, and conducting compatibility testing on different platforms.

\subsection{Accessibility}
The system should be accessible to users with disabilities, conforming to accessibility guidelines such as WCAG 2.0. This includes providing alternative text for images, using proper heading structures, and ensuring keyboard navigation support.

\subsection{Legal and Regulatory Compliance}
The system should comply with relevant laws, regulations, and industry standards. This includes data protection and privacy laws, intellectual property rights, and any specific regulations applicable to the domain of the system.

\subsection{Performance}
The system should be able to handle a large number of concurrent users without significant degradation in response time. To achieve this, the backend server should be optimized for efficient data processing and the database should be properly indexed for quick retrieval of information.
